# TeachingATurtleHowToRun
Trying to get a turtle to "learn" to run from another turtle in Python

Basic premise is an array controls how the "prey" turtle will move depending on which direction the "predator" turtle is coming from. depending on how long the turtle survives being caught it will be scored. The top scoring arrays are preserved, the lowest scoring arrays are deleted. It will then replace the deleted arrays by combining the remaining ones.
